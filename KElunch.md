## Hosting the UK Study Group with Industry

Dear KE Champions

We are seeking proposals from UK University Mathematical Sciences Departments to host one-week European Study Group with Industry (ESGI) meetings in the summer of 2026, 2027, and 2028 (for more info about the ESGI series, please see [https://ecmiindmath.org/study-groups/](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fecmiindmath.org%2Fstudy-groups%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cmax.jensen%40ucl.ac.uk%7C7f5f0eda02bd4a1a07ee08dc74af99ab%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C638513544754691985%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=yJhCcjU8pGdz6q42Gm%2BK641mM9qiPh6nN0S0WPFPzwM%3D&reserved=0)). These will be the flagship in-person UK Study Group meetings, where industrial representatives pose novel real-world challenges to mathematical scientists, and the Study Group participants spend a week dynamically seeking insights and solutions.  
  

Recent hosts have included the Maxwell Institute/ICMS (July 2023), and the University of Kent (July 2022), and the next two meetings will be at University of Birmingham (24-28 June 2024) and University of Bristol (2025). Previous hosts have successfully used Study Groups as a platform for creating and nurturing long-term interactions with commercial organisations. A team of experienced Study Group organisers will be happy to provide advice or support that is needed to deliver the meeting.

_Please submit proposals by_ **17:00 Monday 2 September, 2024**. We welcome applications from all hosts, especially those who have not organised a UK Study Group meeting before, although some experience of participating in such events is important for the organising team (this might be gained by attending the Birmingham meeting 24-28 June 2024). Details about Study Group organisation are included at the end of this email and we are happy to discuss ideas with any group who has preliminary interest, to help guide such submissions or clarify points. 

Proposals should be no more than two pages of A4 (emailed to Rachael Harris at [kehub@newton.ac.uk](mailto:kehub@newton.ac.uk) ) including discussion of the following:

i)                    The role of such a meeting in the strategy of the hosting organisation.

ii)                   The key academic(s) who will be responsible for running the meeting and the experience of the team of participating in Study Groups.

iii)                 A preliminary brief budget of finances for the Study Group.

iv)                 Organisational plans for the meeting, including an indication of which year(s) you bid for and your preferred dates.

  
We look forward to creating an exciting and engaging set of UK Study Group meetings.  
  
Best regards  
Colin Please, David Abrahams, Chris Breward, Cathal Cummins

**Background information to aid in creating proposals**An excellent review of the logistics required to run a Study Group is available at:  [https://mi-network.org/resources/handbook-for-running-a-sustainable-european-study-groups-with-industry/](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmi-network.org%2Fresources%2Fhandbook-for-running-a-sustainable-european-study-groups-with-industry%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cmax.jensen%40ucl.ac.uk%7C7f5f0eda02bd4a1a07ee08dc74af99ab%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C638513544754704555%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TLEYOv%2FVZNNR%2BEpj7la8hdcjkdCNXF%2FvuelOi3SWA6g%3D&reserved=0) . The Study Group requires organisation similar to a conference (with up to 100 participants), and requires a large plenary room and separate breakout rooms for each different challenge, along with accommodation and food, and some local support for administration. A substantial effort is required before the Study Group to identify the industrial challenges to be considered. A typical meeting will have 7 to 9 challenges. Identifying these challenges involves contacting prospective companies, having preliminary discussions to focus the challenge, creating a suitable description, and agreeing funding. The Mathematical Sciences infrastructure, including the INI, ICMS, and KE Hub, may be able to provide some assistance. Previous organisers of Study Groups will be very happy to give advice and support in this problem identification process. We are particularly pleased that reports from such Study Groups can now be published through CUP Open Engage[Mathematics in Industry Reports](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fengage%2Fcoe%2Fpublic-dashboard&data=05%7C02%7Cmax.jensen%40ucl.ac.uk%7C7f5f0eda02bd4a1a07ee08dc74af99ab%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C638513544754713747%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xb6kv0ZzA30jOtMFpTV4RDxlLyDWsdvLFLAjLNp%2B2Uk%3D&reserved=0) and hence participants can gain formal recognition of their contributions. 

A preliminary budget should include costings related to i) accommodation, ii) meals, including a celebratory dinner, iii) room hire, iv) administrative support and also outline expected income from i) industrial challenges (either fully costed or using support for SMEs from other sources), ii) University/department, iii) other sources (eg. charging some graduate students [such as those with funding from training/conference pots] for costs, or leveraging funds from KE Hub, INI, ICMS,  LMS, EMS etc.). Note this is preliminary and hence the number of challenges and participants should be estimated, and it is adequate to give outline costings at current prices and to identify outline sources of income which will be pursued.  The UK Study Group has a small contingency fund that can be used to aid cash flow, but this should normally be returned, along with any surplus generated by the meeting, to help support future meetings. Budgets should be set expecting most participants will not pay for accommodation or meals. 

Contacting the Chair of the Study Group working party ([please@maths.ox.ac.uk](mailto:please@maths.ox.ac.uk)) early in the proposal writing process is highly recommended in order to access past experience, and to discuss possible options, ideas and budgets.

In setting the date of the meeting, proposers should be mindful of constraints, but some flexibility is possible to suit the local institution. The Study Group typically occurs in the July after term has ended (different Universities have vastly different timings, so conflict should be avoided with as many as possible) and the Study Group is typically preceded by a week-long [UK Graduate Modelling Camp](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.newton.ac.uk%2Fevent%2Ftgm132&data=05%7C02%7Cmax.jensen%40ucl.ac.uk%7C7f5f0eda02bd4a1a07ee08dc74af99ab%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C638513544754722249%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6AQbGYp9dv%2FSLg%2FH4TSRgVwVyYCUn%2FHcNhzg6hSuYbM%3D&reserved=0), organised separately, which also needs to be out of term. Proposers should be careful to avoid scheduling their Study Group at the same time as regular relevant conferences, since this might cause a reduction in attendees.
